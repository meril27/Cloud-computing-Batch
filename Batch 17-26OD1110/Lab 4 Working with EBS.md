What is Amazon Elastic Block Store?
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) offers persistent storage for Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EBS volumes are network-attached and persist independently from the life of an instance. Amazon EBS volumes are highly available, highly reliable volumes that can be leveraged as an Amazon EC2 instances boot partition or attached to a running Amazon EC2 instance as a standard block device.

When used as a boot partition, Amazon EC2 instances can be stopped and subsequently restarted, enabling you to pay only for the storage resources used while maintaining your instance's state. Amazon EBS volumes offer greatly improved durability over local Amazon EC2 instance stores because Amazon EBS volumes are automatically replicated on the backend (in a single Availability Zone).

For those wanting even more durability, Amazon EBS provides the ability to create point-in-time consistent snapshots of your volumes that are then stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones. These snapshots can be used as the starting point for new Amazon EBS volumes and can protect your data for long-term durability. You can also easily share these snapshots with co-workers and other AWS developers.

This lab guide explains basic concepts of Amazon EBS in a step-by-step fashion. However, it can only give a brief overview of Amazon EBS concepts. For further information, see the Amazon EBS documentation.

Amazon EBS Volume Features
Amazon EBS volumes deliver the following features:

Persistent storage: Volume lifetime is independent of any particular Amazon EC2 instance.

General purpose: Amazon EBS volumes are raw, unformatted block devices that can be used from any operating system.

High performance: Amazon EBS volumes are equal to or better than local Amazon EC2 drives.

High reliability: Amazon EBS volumes have built-in redundancy within an Availability Zone.

Designed for resiliency: The AFR (Annual Failure Rate) of Amazon EBS is between 0.1% and 1%.

Variable size: Volume sizes range from 1 GB to 16 TB.

Easy to use: Amazon EBS volumes can be easily created, attached, backed up, restored, and deleted.

Accessing the AWS Management Console
At the top of these instructions, click Start Lab to launch your lab.

A Start Lab panel opens displaying the lab status.

Wait until you see the message "Lab status: ready", then click the X to close the Start Lab panel.

At the top of these instructions, click AWS

This will open the AWS Management Console in a new browser tab. The system will automatically log you in.

Tip: If a new browser tab does not open, there will typically be a banner or icon at the top of your browser indicating that your browser is preventing the site from opening pop-up windows. Choose the banner or icon and choose "Allow pop ups."

Arrange the AWS Management Console tab so that it displays along side these instructions. Ideally, you will be able to see both browser tabs at the same time, to make it easier to follow the lab steps.

Task 1: Create a New EBS Volume
In this task, you will create and attach an Amazon EBS volume to a new Amazon EC2 instance.

In the AWS Management Console, on the Services menu, click EC2.

In the left navigation pane, choose Instances.

An Amazon EC2 instance named Lab has already been launched for your lab.

Note the Availability Zone of the instance. It will look similar to us-east-1a.

In the left navigation pane, choose Volumes.

You will see an existing volume that is being used by the Amazon EC2 instance. This volume has a size of 8 GiB, which makes it easy to distinguish from the volume you will create next, which will be 1 GiB in size.

Choose Create volume then configure:

a. Volume Type: General Purpose SSD (gp2)

b. Size (GiB): 1. NOTE: You may be restricted from creating large volumes.

c. Availability Zone: Select the same availability zone as your EC2 instance.

d. Choose Add Tag

e. In the Tag Editor, enter:

i. Key: Name

ii. Value: My Volume

Choose Create Volume

Your new volume will appear in the list, and will move from the Creating state to the Available state. You may need to choose refresh to see your new volume.

Task 2: Attach the Volume to an Instance
You can now attach your new volume to the Amazon EC2 instance.

Select My Volume.

In the Actions menu, choose Attach volume.

Choose the Instance field, then select the instance that appears (Lab).

For the Device Name, choose /dev/sdb/ from the dropdown.

Note: You will use this device identifier in a later task.

Choose Attach volume The volume state is now In-use.

Task 3: Connect to Your Amazon EC2 Instance
In this task, you will connect to the Lab EC2 instance using Session Manager.

In the AWS Management Console, in the EC2 service, choose Instances.

Select the Lab instance.

Choose Connect

Choose the Session Manager tab, then choose Connect

A new browser tab will open with a terminal session connected to the instance.

Run the following command to switch to the ec2-user home directory:

bash
sudo su -l ec2-user
Task 4: Create and Configure Your File System
In this task, you will add the new volume to a Linux instance as an ext3 file system under the /mnt/data-store mount point.

View the storage available on your instance:

bash
df -h
You should see output similar to:

https://media/image2.png

This is showing the original 8GB disk volume. Your new volume is not yet shown.

Create an ext3 file system on the new volume:

bash
sudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sdb
Create a directory for mounting the new storage volume:

bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/data-store
Mount the new volume:

bash
sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt/data-store
To configure the Linux instance to mount this volume whenever the instance is started, you will need to add a line to /etc/fstab.

bash
echo "/dev/sdb /mnt/data-store ext3 defaults,noatime 1 2" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
View the configuration file to see the setting on the last line:

bash
cat /etc/fstab
View the available storage again:

bash
df -h
https://media/image3.png

The output will now contain an additional line - /dev/xvdb:

On your mounted volume, create a file and add some text to it.

bash
sudo sh -c "echo some text has been written > /mnt/data-store/file.txt"
Verify that the text has been written to your volume.

bash
cat /mnt/data-store/file.txt
Task 5: Create an Amazon EBS Snapshot
In this task, you will create a snapshot of your EBS volume.

You can create any number of point-in-time, consistent snapshots from Amazon EBS volumes at any time. Amazon EBS snapshots are stored in Amazon S3 with high durability. New Amazon EBS volumes can be created out of snapshots for cloning or restoring backups. Amazon EBS snapshots can also be easily shared among AWS users or copied over AWS regions.

In the AWS Management Console, choose Volumes and select My Volume.

In the Actions menu, select Create snapshot.

Choose Add tag then configure:

a. Key: Name

b. Value: My Snapshot

c. Choose Create snapshot

In the left navigation pane, choose Snapshots.

Your snapshot is displayed. The status will first have a state of Pending, which means that the snapshot is being created. It will then change to a state of Completed.

Note: Only used storage blocks are copied to snapshots, so empty blocks do not occupy any snapshot storage space.

In your terminal session, delete the file that you created on your volume.

bash
sudo rm /mnt/data-store/file.txt
Verify that the file has been deleted.

bash
ls /mnt/data-store/
Your file has been deleted.

Task 6: Restore the Amazon EBS Snapshot
If you ever wish to retrieve data stored in a snapshot, you can Restore the snapshot to a new EBS volume.

Create a Volume Using Your Snapshot
In the AWS Management Console, select My Snapshot.

In the Actions menu, select Create volume from snapshot.

For Availability Zone Select the same availability zone that you used earlier.

Choose Add tag then configure:

a. Key: Name

b. Value: Restored Volume

c. Choose Create volume

Note: When restoring a snapshot to a new volume, you can also modify the configuration, such as changing the volume type, size or Availability Zone.

Attach the Restored Volume to Your EC2 Instance
In the left navigation pane, choose Volumes.

Select Restored Volume.

In the Actions menu, select Attach volume.

Choose the Instance field, then select the (Lab) instance that appears.

For the Device Name, choose /dev/sdc/ (or any next available identifier) from the dropdown.

Choose Attach volume

The volume state is now in-use.

Mount the Restored Volume
Create a directory for mounting the new storage volume:

bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/data-store2
Mount the new volume:

bash
sudo mount /dev/sdc /mnt/data-store2
Verify that volume you mounted has the file that you created earlier.

bash
ls /mnt/data-store2/
You should see file.txt.
